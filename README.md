# Suicide-Risk-Detection
NLP project for detecting suicide risk from text.
This project focuses on identifying potential suicide risk from textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The system performs text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and classification using multiple ML models to accurately categorize user text into risk levels. A user-friendly Streamlit web application is also developed to enable real-time prediction and interaction. The project demonstrates end-to-end implementation including data cleaning, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
